# Gatsby App + Netlify CMS Starter App! 

This app was built using a template from https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters!

The main idea of this app was to have an online notepad that could utilize short notes and images to keep track of random ideas and facts. 

Most of the time I have the habit of using two journals, post its, notepad on my phone, text messages and emails to send quick notes for random needs.

This is not so problematic when I am using just 1 computer but when I am using three computers and two phones at the same time. This actually gets pretty complicated. Especially when on the go.

There nothing like going into a meeting with while on a call and answering an email at the same time.

Notes end up in the wrong place and written the wrong way. 

I love these notes that are passwords for usernames and websites. I have already forgotten but will need to revert to at a later time.

Therfore the goal was to build a quick and Easy Journal to use on the run. Write a quick note instead of texting it to your self and etc...

Tech used: Gatsby, starter app!



Side note:

**I just realized that I could probably just use a google doc and embed a google sheet into it and make it into an iframe within a website.....
**
Thats an actual note for myself later instead of using the reminder app. In addition I should install a timer function that connects to google calendar for funko, sneaker and gpu drops....
